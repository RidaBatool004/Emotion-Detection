**Text Emotion Detection System**

**Overview**

This project implements a text emotion detection system to identify emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust) in textual data. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to preprocess text, extract features, and classify emotions, with applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback, and mental health monitoring.

**Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans text by removing noise, tokenizing, and applying lemmatization.
- Models: Trained with Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluation: Measured with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**Deployment**

The text emotion detection model is deployed on Hugging Face for easy access and testing:
